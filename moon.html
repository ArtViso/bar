                    Only 24 humans have been to the Moon, and no one has been back since 1972. Today, NASA announced
                    they have selected Starship to land the first astronauts on the lunar surface since the Apollo
                    program. We are humbled to help NASA usher in a new era of human space exploration.
                    </br></br>
                    Together, NASA and SpaceX have successfully executed similarly bold and innovative partnerships,
                    including restoring America’s ability to launch astronauts to orbit and return them safely home. We
                    will build upon our shared accomplishments, and leverage years of close technical collaboration to
                    return to the Moon. In doing so, we will lay the groundwork for human exploration to Mars and
                    beyond.
                    </br></br>
                    Sustaining a human presence on the Moon will require the safe and affordable transportation of crew
                    and significant amounts of cargo. SpaceX’s Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket represent an
                    integrated and fully reusable launch, propellant delivery, rendezvous, and planetary lander system
                    with robust capabilities and safety features uniquely designed to deliver these essential building
                    blocks.

            <div class="grid-item c2 wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRightBig">
                <p>Flying between lunar orbit and the surface of the Moon, Starship will carry crew and all of the
                    supplies, equipment, and science payloads needed for extensive surface exploration. Building off the
                    safety and reliability of Dragon and Falcon, Starship will feature proven avionics, guidance and
                    navigation systems, autonomous rendezvous, docking and precision landing capabilities, as well as
                    thermal protection, and a spacious cabin with familiar displays and interfaces utilized on Dragon.
                    </br></br>
                    SpaceX is rapidly advancing Starship development, drawing on an extensive history of launch vehicle
                    and engine development programs. Since January 2020, SpaceX has built 10 Starship prototypes, with
                    production and fidelity accelerating on each build. SpaceX has manufactured and tested more than 60
                    of Starship’s Raptor engines, accumulating nearly 30,000 seconds of total test time over 567 engine
                    starts, including on multiple Starship static fires and flight tests. We have conducted six
                    suborbital flight tests, including two 150-m hops and four high-altitude flights. SpaceX has also
                    built a full-size Super Heavy booster as part of a pathfinder effort, and currently has five
                    vehicles in production.
                    </br></br>
                    We are honored to be a part of NASA’s Artemis Program to safely land the first woman and next man on
                    the surface of the Moon, as the first of many, many more people to follow.</p>
